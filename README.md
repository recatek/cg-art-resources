#### [YanSculpts](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfjswDVU0XHyBN7UFG0Mi5Q)
Lots of videos on character sculpting with some discussion of sculpting and anatomy. Channel is a little "HEY WHATS UP YOUTUBE ITS YA BOY" but once you get past the intros there's lots of good content.

#### [Lukas Kutschera](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChIOHon9KXDp3-S8uAEBdGQ)
Has a great series on sculpting a realistic human with very specific anatomical detail. Uses ZBrush but theory carries over the practice in Blender.

## Paid Resources
### Books
#### [Anatomy for Sculptors](https://anatomy4sculptors.com/) ($45-$55) - THR
Very useful picture-book with demonstrations on how to break down human anatomy into more basic shapes for sculpting, and better picture the bones and muscles and their arrangement under the skin.
### Courses
#### [CG Boost](https://cgboost.com/academy/) ($~60 per) - THR, MEC
Handful of courses for Blender and other tools like Substance Painter. Haven't tried any yet but they come highly recommended.
